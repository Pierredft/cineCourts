1
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.810
Okay, everybody.

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.650
We're all set.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.310
Rolling.

4
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.310
Okay Ralph, can you do the
opening clap for me please?

5
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.050
You want me to do it now?

6
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.910
Okay, go ahead.

8
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.340
Just like that.

9
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.910
Oh, perfect.

10
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.800
Oh, just like in the movies.

11
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.180
That's it.

12
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.490
So my name is Ralph.

13
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm a rabbit, as you can see.

14
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.500
I'm blind in my right eye and this
ear, it can't hear anything except

15
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.790
that whistling sound.

16
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.810
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

17
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.240
It's a pain, isn't it?

18
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.620
Yeah, it is.

19
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.720
So I've had my fur shaved off and
I've got chemical burns all over my

20
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.990
back.

21
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.990
It stings a bit, but it's not so bad,
it really hurts when I breathe or

22
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.690
move.

23
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.100
Ouch!

24
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.340
Ouch!

25
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.530
Yes, yes, it hurts.

26
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.490
But in the end, it doesn't
matter, we do it for humans, right?

27
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.160
They're far
superior to us, the animals.

28
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.810
They've even been to space.

29
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.870
Have you ever seen
a rabbit in a rocket?

30
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.100
I don't think so.

31
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.570
My point is, I'm not a space bunny.

32
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.680
I'm a tester.

33
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.030
My father was a tester.

34
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.150
My mother, my brothers, my
sisters, my children, all testers.

35
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.860
And they all died doing their jobs.

36
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.440
I know what's in store for me, but it
doesn't matter, we were born to test,

37
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.260
it makes us rabbits happy.

38
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.470
Hmm.

39
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.640
Mwah.

40
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.320
Pffff.

41
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.010
Ah!

42
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.900
I've got to get to work.

43
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.090
And.

44
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.060
I know it sounds awful, but
to me, I'm just doing my job.

45
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.000
If nothing but a human can feel
like a safer or delighted lipstick or

46
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.220
deodorant.

47
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.440
What's with the camera crew, buddy?

48
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.090
Oh, they're following me around
to make a documentary or something.

49
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.520
You can ask them if
they can get us out of here.

50
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.630
Like grandpa said.

51
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.260
If you'd like.

52
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.690
If you don't want to.

53
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.000
It's okay guys, I get it.

54
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.140
You can.

55
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.850
You can cut that out, right?

56
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.040
Oh, here we go!

57
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.920
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

58
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.520
Ouch!

59
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.150
So.

60
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.050
So, in conclusion,
I'd like to say that.

61
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.400
Ah, sorry.

62
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.060
Sorry, Ralph.

63
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.320
Sorry, Ralph.

64
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.700
Could you please turn around?

65
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.540
Sorry, Ralph.

66
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.440
No, that's okay.

67
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.820
That's better.

68
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.750
Yes, yes, that's much better.

69
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.750
But thank you, my friend.

70
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.680
Keep going, keep going.

71
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.370
Okay.

72
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.790
So there you have it, I'd just like
to say to everyone who still buys

73
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.740
cosmetics tested on animals like eye
pencils, shampoo, sunscreen, pretty

74
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.980
much everything in your bathroom.

75
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.600
Well, without you and without the
countries that allow animal testing,

76
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.480
I'd be out of a job.

77
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.590
I'd be homeless.

78
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.020
Well, not really
homeless, more like in a field.

79
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.130
What do you see?

80
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.720
Like a normal rabbit.

81
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.750
But hey.

82
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.960
It's all good.
